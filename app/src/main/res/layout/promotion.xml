A player may drop a captured piece on any empty square on the board as his own (that's why the pieces are differentiated only by their oriented tips, not by colors).  By dropping a piece, a check can be given (endangering of the king does not have to be announced), or even a checkmate can be given (except by a pawn).  A piece can be dropped in the path of danger and to cancel a check.  A piece is always dropped unpromoted side up, even if dropped into the promotion zone.  A piece should be dropped on a field where it is still possible to move such a piece for at least one more move. Pawns and lances cannot be dropped onto the last row while knights cannot be dropped on the last two rows.  A pawn cannot be dropped in a column containing another unpromoted pawn of the same player (promoted pawns do not count).  A pawn cannot be dropped to give an immediate checkmate (although other pieces can); however, pawns may give checkmate on any subsequent move after the pawn was dropped." />
