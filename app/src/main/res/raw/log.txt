Problem: wanted a nice grid for the board
Source: https://github.com/rtsfred3/Shogi/app/src/main/java/edu/up/cs371/resop18
            /shogi/shogi/ShogiGui.java
Solution: I took this handmade GUI and stripped it away to just include the board that I needed.
    I made other adjustments as I saw fit, and then I integrated this GUI into our layout.
